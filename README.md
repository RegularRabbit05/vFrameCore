## vFrameTool Encoder
An app used for some of my projects to decode a video to "png" frames and save them into a single file also saving the framerate and the amount of frames

This is a really simple encoding that shouldn't be used when memory or disk space is a concern, but it may be used to simplify the usage of RayLib's LoadImageFromMemory() for playing videos <br>
Check out [this repository](https://github.com/RegularRabbit05/vFrameReader) for an example on how to use this file format.
